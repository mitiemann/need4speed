# Need 4 speed: the 2 language expression problem (WIP)

A talk discussing how to achieve a programming language with rapid prototyping and rapid execution.

## Notes to myself

- I need to switch to Jupyterlab since I need to evaluate Haskell and some OOP language
- To start my way of running Jupyterlab:
  ``` bash
  cd opt/IHaskell
  source venv/bin/activate
  jupyter lab --no-browser
  ```
- `jupyter notebook` gave me 403 errors, but Jupyterlab works
- Need to check out [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (and possibly this [demo talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZoO3npjwYU))
